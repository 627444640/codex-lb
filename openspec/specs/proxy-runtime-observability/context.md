# Proxy Runtime Observability Context

## Purpose and Scope

This capability defines what operators should be able to see in the live server console while debugging proxy traffic.

See `openspec/specs/proxy-runtime-observability/spec.md` for normative requirements.

## Decisions

- **Timestamps are always on:** timestamped console logs are a baseline operator need, not a debug-only feature.
- **Request tracing is opt-in:** outbound request summary and payload tracing remain configurable because payload logs can be noisy or sensitive. Since issue #1340 phase 1 the switch is the single `CODEX_LB_TRACE` comma-separated channel list (`shape`, `shape_raw_cache_key`, `payload`, `service_tier`, `upstream_summary`, `upstream_payload`); empty default = all off. It is an incident-debugging knob for interactive use only.
- **Error logs must be correlated:** request id, endpoint, status, code, and message are the minimum useful fields for debugging 4xx/5xx failures.
- **Prewarm observability is outcome-only:** the Codex HTTP-bridge prewarm canary experiment finished, so its bucket/cohort dimensions were retired (issue #1340 phase 4). The `codex_lb_http_bridge_prewarm_total` counter is labelled by `outcome` only, request logs record `prewarm_status` / `prewarm_latency_ms` (statuses: `not_applicable`, `skipped`, `success`, `timeout`, `error` — `canary_miss` no longer occurs), and the legacy `prewarm_canary_bucket` / `prewarm_eligible_reason` request-log columns stay declared but unwritten for one release for rolling-upgrade safety; the Alembic drop revision ships next release (see the next-release queue in `openspec/specs/deployment-installation/context.md`).
- **TTFT datasource selection stays in Grafana:** the Helm chart packages the
  TTFT dashboard but does not provision a PostgreSQL datasource or its
  credentials. The visible, single-select `DS_SQL` variable keeps
  installation-specific datasource UIDs out of chart values while routing all
  four SQL panels through one explicit selection.

## Operational Notes

- Use request ids to correlate inbound proxy logs, outbound upstream traces, and client-visible failures.
- Prefer summary tracing in normal debugging sessions; enable payload tracing only when the exact normalized outbound request matters.
- For direct compact `5xx` failures, look for `proxy_compact_failure` alongside `upstream_request_complete`; together they show the compact failure phase, failure detail, exception type, retry metadata, and affinity source.
- After the Grafana sidecar imports the TTFT dashboard, select the ordinary
  PostgreSQL datasource that points to the codex-lb database from the visible
  **PostgreSQL** dropdown. A datasource registered only as a frontend runtime
  plugin is not listed by Grafana's datasource variable.
- Timeout invariant violation logs describe startup `Settings` and imported
  constant validation only. They intentionally avoid request-scoped overrides,
  runtime-derived effective timeout values, payloads, API keys, access tokens,
  raw affinity keys, account emails, and other high-cardinality identifiers.


## Request cost evidence

Request cost figures are retail API estimates. Input tokens include cached
reads and cache writes; output tokens include reasoning. Request logs preserve
the original model alongside the reported actual model, cache-write evidence
and a pricing version. Missing metadata is never manufactured by migration.

Stored historical amounts remain unchanged when the price table changes.
Previously unpriced rows may show a current estimate, with incomplete-usage
status when cache writes are unreported; this display does not backfill stored
or folded totals. Aggregate amounts therefore identify their known portion.
Unknown public models have no invented price, and explicitly unknown image
costs remain unknown after reads and later pricing-table updates.

For a concrete example, 16,280 input tokens (15,104 cached reads and 100 writes)
and 63 output tokens total 16,343 tokens. At the Luna standard short-context
2026-09-14 snapshot, the estimate is $0.00061788, displayed as $0.000618.

Prices are verified from the [official pricing table](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing)
and [cache usage documentation](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching#monitor-cache-performance).
They represent API estimates, not subscription credit charges or an invoice.
